## Issue Reporting Guidelines

1. Make sure the issue is in fact related to this repository.
2. If you're experiencing an issue, then first check websites such as [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=social-web-login) for answers.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `main`, and merge back to that branch.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub will automatically squash it before merging.

- Make sure `npm test` passes. (see [development setup](#development-setup))

- If adding a new feature:
  - Add accompanying test case.
  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing bug:
  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update reconciler to handle a missing case (fix #1234)`.
  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.

## Development Setup

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **version 14+** and that's it.

After cloning the repo, run:

``` bash
$ npm ci # install the dependencies of the project
```

## Committing

Commit messages should follow the [commit message convention](./COMMIT_CONVENTION.md) so that changelogs can be automatically generated. Commit messages will be automatically validated upon commit. If you are not familiar with the commit message convention, you can use `npx cz` instead of `git commit`, which provides an interactive CLI for generating the proper commit message. This is the recommended way of committing.

## Publishing

Happens via [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) after merged PRs.

## Commonly used NPM scripts

``` bash
# build
$ npm run build

# test
$ npm test

# lint
$ npm run lint
```

There are some other scripts available in the `scripts` section of the main `package.json` file.

The `npm run test` will run all tests. **Please make sure to have this pass successfully before submitting a PR.** Although the same tests will run against your PR on the CI server (using `npx run test-ci`), it is better to have it working locally. You can also run this locally to get a clue on what the code coverage looks like after your changes.

## Project Structure

Some conventions on file and directory structure:

- [README.md](https://github.com/chickencoding123/blob/main/README.md) contains the summary of the project and relevant resources.
- [.gitignore](https://github.com/chickencoding123/blob/main/.gitignore) contains the files that `git` must ignore.
- [.eslintrc.json](https://github.com/chickencoding123/blob/main/.eslintrc.json) contains `eslint` configuration.
- [jest.config.js](https://github.com/chickencoding123/blob/main/jest.config.js) is the configuration for running tests via `jest`.
- [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/chickencoding123/blob/main/tsconfig.json) configurations for the `typescript`.
- `@types`: `typescript` type augmentations go in this directory, if any, otherwise this directory does not exist.
- `*test.ts`: `jest` test cases
